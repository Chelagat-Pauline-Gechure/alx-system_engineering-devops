**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** July 15, 2023, 10:30 AM - 1:45 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:** Degraded performance of our e-commerce platform; 30% of users experienced slow response times.
- **Root Cause:** Database connection pool exhaustion due to a misconfigured connection timeout parameter.

**Timeline:**
- **10:30 AM:** Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts showing increased response times.
- **10:35 AM:** Engineering team alerted; initial investigation began.
- **10:50 AM:** Assumed potential server overload; scaled resources horizontally.
- **11:15 AM:** Response times improved but didn't resolve completely; suspected database issues.
- **11:45 AM:** Investigated database queries; noticed a spike in connections.
- **12:30 PM:** Misleading assumption: Suspected a recent code deployment causing inefficient queries.
- **1:00 PM:** Issue escalated to Database Operations team.
- **1:30 PM:** Root cause identified: Connection pool misconfiguration leading to resource exhaustion.
- **1:45 PM:** Resolved by adjusting connection timeout parameter; normal system performance restored.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The root cause was identified as a misconfigured connection timeout parameter in the database connection pool. The default timeout was too short, leading to premature termination of connections, creating a bottleneck in the system. This resulted in an increased number of open connections, exhausting the available resources and causing the degradation of system performance.

To resolve the issue, we adjusted the connection timeout parameter to a more appropriate value. This change allowed connections to persist for a reasonable duration, preventing premature termination and effectively eliminating the bottleneck. With the adjustment, the database connection pool operated optimally, and the e-commerce platform returned to normal performance.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
**Things to Improve/Fix:**
1. **Automated Monitoring:** Enhance automated monitoring to detect and alert on abnormal connection pool behavior.
2. **Documentation:** Improve documentation regarding the impact of various database connection pool parameters on system performance.

**Tasks:**
1. **Update Connection Timeout:** Ensure that connection timeout parameters are appropriately configured in all environments.
2. **Review Deployment Processes:** Implement a more robust code deployment process that includes thorough testing for potential database performance impacts.
3. **Training:** Conduct training sessions to raise awareness among engineers about the impact of database configurations on system performance.
4. **Regular Audits:** Establish a routine audit schedule for critical system configurations to catch potential issues proactively.
5. **Post-Incident Review:** Conduct a detailed post-incident review involving all teams to share learnings and identify further opportunities for improvement.

This incident serves as a reminder of the critical role proper configuration plays in maintaining the reliability of our systems. By implementing the outlined corrective and preventative measures, we aim to fortify our infrastructure against similar issues in the future, ensuring a seamless experience for our users and maintaining the high standards they expect from our e-commerce platform.
